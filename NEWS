# version 2.2.2

- Fixed duplicate multilayer edges in writing function.

# version 2.2.1

- Fixed I/O bugs.

# version 2.2

- Added resolution parameter and weights to generalised Louvain.

- Fixed set_values() to allow multiple actors to be specified.

- Small updates to documentation.

- Updated layer degree correlation: the correlation is now computed on the degree, not the number of neighbours. That is, if a vertex V has two incident edges V -> U and V <- U, its degree with mode INOUT is 2 (it was previously 1, as the neighbour is the same).

- Updated clique percolation: fixed a missing duplicate check (potentially leading to redundant sub-communities being returned) and now automatically discarding directionality if executed on a directed graph.

# version 2.1

- Added pyproject.toml configuration

# version 2.0

- Aligned interface of actors() with R version, now returning a dictionary
- get_values() and set_values() require a dictionary also for actors
- added the option to add attribute values to actors(), vertices(), and edges()

# version 1.1.4

- Fixed bug on get_edges (could swap layers)

# version 1.1.3

- Fixed bug on get_values when applied to edges (did not return the values)
- Updated license

# version 1.1.2

- values2graphics supports up to 12 distinct values (not included in previous version)

# version 1.1.1

- values2graphics supports up to 12 distinct values
- Fixed bug in generate_communities (was returning only with input "pep")

# version 1.1

- Updated description

# version 1.0

- The multilayer network data structure has been re-implemented using multilayer cubes
- Actors must exist on at least one layer
- Removed actor Pucci from florentine data, not being present in any layer
- Added generate_communities, to create simple community structures
- Added flat_ec, flat_nw and mdlp clustering algorithms
- Added nmi and omega_index evaluation functions

# version 0.10

- New default: loops are allowed.

# version 0.9

- Added project()
